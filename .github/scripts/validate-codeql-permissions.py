"""
Validate that CodeQL workflows have correct permissions configuration.

This script ensures that any GitHub Actions workflow job that uses 
'github/codeql-action/analyze' has the 'security-events: write' permission 
defined at the job-level, not at the root-level.

This helps maintain security best practices by following the principle of 
least privilege for GitHub Actions permissions.
